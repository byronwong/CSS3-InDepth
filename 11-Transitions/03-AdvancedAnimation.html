	Animation Shorthand 
	===================

	// long hand 

	.pencil {
		animation-name: drawline;
		animation-duration:5s;
		animation-delay: 100ms;
		animation-timing-function: ease-in-out;
		animation-iteration-count:5;
	}

	// short hand 
	animation: drawline 5s ease-in-out 100ms 5;

	// NOTE: duration must always come before delay


	Animation Fill mode
	===================

	animation-fill-mode: none | forwards | backwards | both

	default: none
	forwards - stay on frame 100% forever / until the animation is removed from the element
	backwards - will apply the properties of the starting keyframe or end of delay: 
	both - will take on properties of at the start and take on end properties at the end


	Animation play state
	====================

	animation-play-state: paused | running // can pause the animation


	What happens when an animation ends
	===================================

	events are fired:
	animationstart
	animationend
	animationiteration

	el.addEventLisener('webkitAnimationEnd', function(){
		function(event){
			console.log('animation ended');
		}
	}, flase);
